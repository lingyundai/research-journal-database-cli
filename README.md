### Running the program
Please import the attached .zip copy of the project in Visual Studio. You should see a directory structure like this, including the resource .jar files and .vscode configuration folder.

If you run the program in visual studio, please use the "Run and Debug" configuration named "Main with input file"

If you run with the default play button on the right side of the editor, you will get an error!

This is because we have set up a custom run configuration in our .vscode launch.json file.
